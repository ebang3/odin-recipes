        <li>1 lb. cylinder shaped rice cake (tteok)</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>7 large size dried anchovies, head and intestine removed</li>
        <li>6 x 8 inch dried kelp</li>
        <li>1/3 cup hot pepper paste (gochujang)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>3 green onions (scallions), cut into 3 inch long pieces</li>
        <li>2 hard boiled eggs, shelled</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. fish cakes</li>        
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the water, dried anchovies, and dried kelp to a shallow pot or pan.</li>
        <li>Boil for 15 minutes over medium high heat without the lid.</li>
        <li>Combine gochujang (hot pepper paste), gochugaru (hot pepper flakes), and sugar in a small bowl. Remove the anchovies and
        kelp from the pot and add the rice cake, the mixture in the bowl, the green onion, and the optional fish cakes and hard
        boiled eggs. The stock will be about 2Â½ cups.</li>
        <li>Stir gently with a wooden spoon when it starts to boil. Let it simmer and keep stirring until the rice cake turns soft
        and the tteokbokki sauce thickens and looks shiny, which should take about 10 to 15 minutes. If the rice cake is not
        soft enough, add more water and continue stirring until it softens. When you use freshly made rice cake, it takes
        shorter time. If you use frozen rice cake, thaw it out and soak in cold water to soften it before cooking.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and serve hot. If you have any leftovers, just keep them in the fridge and reheat them when you
        want to eat. You should finished it in a few days.</li>
    </ol>
